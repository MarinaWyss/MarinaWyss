## Hey, I'm Marina 👋

- 🔬 I’m an Applied Scientist at Twitch/Amazon, where I primarily work in the areas of content understanding using Gen AI, forecasting, and MLOps/infrastructure.
- 🐍 I primarily work with Python, SQL, AWS, PyTorch, Tensorflow, and Airflow (but I like learning other stuff, too).
- 📖 My Master's degree is in Public Policy (weird I know, but it was basically social data science). I'm also doing another Master's in Computer Science for fun/because I don't know how to chill.
- 📹 I make videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@Gratitude.Driven) on data science, machine learning, productivity, and personal growth. I also have a [newsletter](https://www.gratitudedriven.com/subscribe) on those topics. I recently started blogging on [Medium](https://medium.com/@gratitudedriven), too.
- 💬 Since 2022 I've been mentoring folks 1:1 on how to break into tech. You can book a call with me [here](https://topmate.io/marina_wyss).
- 🤐 I am constantly coding and working on new stuff, but since I obviously can't share projects I do at work or for grad school, the stuff here is mostly out of date/much smaller scale than my professional work. FWIW.
