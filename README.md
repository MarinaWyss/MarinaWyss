## Hey, I'm Marina 👋

- 🔬 I’m a Senior Applied Scientist at Twitch/Amazon, where I primarily work in the areas of content understanding using Gen AI, forecasting, and MLOps/infrastructure.
- 🐍 I primarily work with Python, SQL, AWS, PyTorch, Tensorflow, and Airflow (but I like learning other stuff, too).
- 📹 I make videos on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@MarinaWyssAI) on data science & AI/ML, as well as a [second channel](https://www.youtube.com/@GratitudeDriven) dedicated to mindset and personal growth. I also have a [newsletter](https://www.gratitudedriven.com) on those topics. I recently started blogging on [Medium](https://medium.com/@gratitudedriven), too.
- 💬 Since 2022 I've been mentoring folks 1:1 on how to break into tech. You can book a call with me [here](https://topmate.io/marina_wyss).
- 🤐 I am constantly coding and working on new stuff, but since I obviously can't share projects I do at work, the stuff here is mostly out of date/much smaller scale than my professional work. FWIW.
